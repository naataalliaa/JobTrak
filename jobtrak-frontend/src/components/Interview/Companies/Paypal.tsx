            'Given an unsorted array, make a pass through the array and count the number of elements that fall within the specified range. This can be done in O(n) time complexity by iterating through the array and checking if each element falls within the range. The count of elements that satisfy the condition can be incremented accordingly',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            'Given a string and a series of range queries, iterate through each query and extract the substring defined by the range. Then, count the number of specific characters within the substring. This can be done by iterating through the substring and counting the occurrences of the specified character',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            'To rearrange an unsorted array so that elements alternate between high and low values, first sort the array in ascending order. Then, create a new array and rearrange the elements by picking the highest and lowest values alternately from the sorted array',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            'To implement an LRU cache, use a combination of a hash map and a doubly linked list. The hash map stores the key-value pairs, and the doubly linked list maintains the order of elements based on their usage. When an element is accessed, it is moved to the front of the list. When the cache is full, the least recently used item at the end of the list is evicted',
