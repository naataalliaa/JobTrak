            'The Kth largest element can be found using quick select or a max heap. Quick select is a modified quick sort algorithm that finds the Kth largest element in an array in O(n) time on average. It works by partitioning the array around a pivot element and recursively selecting the partition that contains the Kth largest element. A max heap can also be used to find the Kth largest element in O(n log K) time. The heap is built from the input array, and the top K elements are extracted to find the Kth largest element.',

            'To reverse the words in a string without reversing the characters, the string can be split into words using a space delimiter. The words are then reversed and concatenated in reverse order to form the final string. This approach maintains the order of the characters within each word while reversing the words themselves.',

            'To determine if a string containing parentheses is valid, a stack can be used to keep track of the opening parentheses. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, it is checked against the top of the stack to ensure that the parentheses match. If the parentheses match, the opening parenthesis is popped from the stack. If the stack is empty at the end of the string, the input string is valid.',

            'To find two numbers that add up to a target value, a hash map can be used to store the indices of the elements as they are traversed. For each element in the array, the difference between the target value and the element is calculated. If the difference is present in the hash map, the indices of the two elements are returned. Otherwise, the index of the element is stored in the hash map for future lookups.',

            'To merge overlapping intervals, the intervals are first sorted based on their start times. The algorithm then iterates through the sorted intervals, merging overlapping intervals as it goes. If the current interval overlaps with the previous interval, the end time of the previous interval is updated to the maximum of the two end times. If the current interval does not overlap, the previous interval is added to the result and the current interval becomes the new previous interval.'

            'To reverse a singly linked list, the list can be traversed iteratively or recursively. In the iterative approach, a pointer is used to keep track of the current node, the next node, and the previous node. The next node is stored, and the current node\'s next pointer is updated to point to the previous node. The previous node, current node, and next node pointers are then shifted to the right. In the recursive approach, the function is called recursively on the next node, and the current node\'s next pointer is updated in the reverse order as the function calls return.',

            'Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass. This allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably based on their common superclass. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in the superclass. This allows the same method call to produce different results based on the object\'s actual class at runtime.',

            'SQL joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Inner joins return rows when there is at least one match in both tables. Left joins return all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table, with null values for the right table when there is no match. Right joins are the opposite of left joins, returning all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. Outer joins return all rows when there is a match in either table, with null values for unmatched rows.',

The formula calculates the area of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices. The formula involves summing the products of the x-coordinates of the vertices with the y-coordinates of the next vertex, and subtracting the products of the y-coordinates with the x-coordinates of the next vertex. The absolute value of the result is divided by 2 to get the area of the triangle.'
