            '<strong>To check if a binary tree is a valid binary search tree,</strong> you can perform an in-order traversal of the tree and check if the resulting list of values is sorted in ascending order. If it is, then the tree is a valid binary search tree.',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            '<strong>To implement an LRU cache,</strong> you can use a combination of a doubly linked list and a hash map. The doubly linked list will keep track of the order of the elements in the cache, with the most recently used element at the front and the least recently used element at the back. The hash map will allow for quick lookups of elements in the cache.',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            '<strong>To design a tic-tac-toe game,</strong> you can represent the game board as a 3x3 matrix and keep track of the current player\'s turn. You can then implement functions to check for a win condition, update the game board with each player\'s move, and switch players after each turn.',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            '<strong>To reverse a linked list,</strong> you can iterate through the list and change the pointers of each node to point to the previous node instead of the next node. You will also need to keep track of the current, previous, and next nodes while traversing the list.',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            '<strong>To find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference in an array of integers,</strong> you can first sort the array and then iterate through it to find the pairs with the smallest absolute difference. You can keep track of the minimum difference and update it as you find smaller differences.'

            '<strong>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)</strong> is a protocol used for transmitting data over the internet.<br /><br /> <strong>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)</strong> is a secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect data. HTTPS is commonly used for secure transactions, such as online banking and shopping, to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            '<strong>To optimize a database query that is running too slow,</strong> you can use techniques such as indexing, query optimization, and database tuning. Indexing involves creating indexes on columns that are frequently queried, while query optimization involves rewriting the query to improve performance. Database tuning involves adjusting database parameters and configurations to improve overall performance.',

            '<strong>Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems in software development.</strong> They provide a template for solving design problems and help developers communicate and collaborate effectively. Design patterns are important because they promote code reusability, maintainability, and scalability, and they help developers write clean, modular, and maintainable code.',
            '<br /><strong>Answer:</strong><br /><br />' +
            '<strong>Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time, while parallelism is the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.</strong> Concurrency is achieved by interleaving tasks and switching between them, while parallelism is achieved by executing tasks in parallel using multiple processors or cores. Concurrency is typically used to improve responsiveness and resource utilization, while parallelism is used to improve performance and throughput.',
